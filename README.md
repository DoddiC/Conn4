# Connect 4

## Info

Connect 4 is a two-player game where the objective is to connect four
tokens of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
before your opponent. Player 1 uses red tokens while Player 2 uses
yellow tokens. By default, Player 1 will always go first. After
determining who will be Player 1, the players take turns dropping
their tokens into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall from
top to bottom, occupying the next available space within the column.
